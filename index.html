    <h1>Hello world and all who inhabit it</h1>
    <p id="fp"> Hi there. My name is Anayra Colon and I'm a junior at KIPP NYC College Prep 
    I am interested about science and technology and I want to major in Computer Science. 
    In my spare time, I'm on Snapchat, texting, or eating pineapples just pure teenagery and what not.
    I'm gonna make a living by working at Google because I believe I can fulfill my interests in technology by working there.

    <p>Being apart of these teams showed me how effective teamwork is because there were many times where we lost games because of the lack of teamwork. However, these sports helped shape me into a leader because I created to strategies to help my team win games and also helped girls how to play the sport effectively</p>
